Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the **sort** operation to order your
results from read operations with the MongoDB Kotlin driver.

The sort operation orders the documents returned from your query by your specified 
**sort criteria**. Sort criteria are the rules you pass to MongoDB that describe
how you would like your data to be ordered. Some examples of sort criteria are:

* Smallest number to largest number
* Earliest time of day to latest time of day
* Alphabetical order by first name 

You should read this guide if you would like to:

* Perform ascending sorts and descending sorts.
* Combine sort criteria.
* Sort on the text score of a
  :manual:`text search </core/text-search-operators/>`.

.. _sorts-crud-sort-sample:

The examples in this guide use a sample collection that contains the following
documents:
  
.. code-block:: json
  
   {"_id": 1, "letter": "c", "food": "coffee with milk"}
   {"_id": 3, "letter": "a", "food": "maple syrup"}
   {"_id": 4, "letter": "b", "food": "coffee with sugar"}
   {"_id": 5, "letter": "a", "food": "milk and cookies"}
   {"_id": 2, "letter": "a", "food": "donuts and coffee"}
   {"_id": 6, "letter": "c", "food": "maple donut"}

This data is modeled with the following Kotlin data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/SortTest.snippet.sort-data-model.kt
   :language: kotlin

Methods For Sorting
-------------------

You can sort results retrieved by a query and you can sort results 
within an aggregation pipeline. To sort your query results, use the
``sort()`` method of a ``FindFlow`` instance. To sort your results within an 
aggregation pipeline, use the ``Aggregates.sort()`` static factory method. Both
of these methods receive objects that implement the ``Bson`` interface as
arguments. For more information, see our API Documentation for the 
`BSON interface <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/conversions/Bson.html>`__.

You can use the ``sort()`` method of a ``FindFlow`` instance as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/SortTest.snippet.basic-sort.kt
   :language: kotlin
 
You can use the ``Aggregates.sort()`` method within an aggregation pipeline to 
sort the documents in the
:ref:`sample collection <sorts-crud-sort-sample>` from smallest to
largest value of the ``_id`` field as follows:
 
.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SortTest.snippet.aggregation-sort.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      FoodOrder(id=1, letter=c, food=coffee with milk)
      FoodOrder(id=2, letter=a, food=donuts and coffee)
      FoodOrder(id=3, letter=a, food=maple syrup)
      FoodOrder(id=4, letter=b, food=coffee with sugar)
      FoodOrder(id=5, letter=a, food=milk and cookies)
      FoodOrder(id=6, letter=c, food=maple donut)

In the preceding code snippets, we specify our sort criteria using the ``Sorts``
builder class. While it is possible to specify sort criteria using any class
that implements the ``Bson`` interface, we recommend that you specify sort
criteria through the ``Sorts`` builder. For more information on the ``Sorts``
builder class, see our
:doc:`guide on the Sorts builder </fundamentals/builders/sort/>`.    

For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see the
following API Documentation:

- `Document <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/Document.html>`__

Sorting Direction
-----------------

The direction of your sort can either be **ascending** or **descending**.
An ascending sort orders your results from smallest to largest. A
descending sort orders your results from largest to smallest.

Here are some examples of data sorted in ascending order:

* Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 43, 43, 55, 120
* Dates: 1990-03-10, 1995-01-01, 2005-10-30, 2005-12-21 
* Words (ASCII): Banana, Dill, carrot, cucumber, hummus

Here are some examples of data sorted in descending order:

* Numbers: 100, 30, 12, 12, 9, 3, 1
* Dates: 2020-01-01, 1998-12-11, 1998-12-10, 1975-07-22 
* Words (reverse ASCII): pear, grapes, apple, Cheese

The following subsections show how to specify these sort criteria.

Ascending
~~~~~~~~~

To specify an ascending sort, use the ``Sorts.ascending()`` static
factory method. Pass the ``Sorts.ascending()`` method
the name of the field you need to sort in ascending order.

You can pass the ``sort()`` method the output of the ``Sorts.ascending()``
method to specify an ascending sort on a field as follows:

.. code-block:: kotlin

   collection.find().sort(Sorts.ascending("<field name>"))

The preceding ``sort()`` method returns a ``FindIterable`` object that can iterate
over the documents in your collection, sorted from smallest to largest on the
specified field name. 

In the following code example, we use the ``ascending()`` method to sort the
:ref:`sample collection <sorts-crud-sort-sample>`  
by the ``_id`` field:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SortTest.snippet.ascending-sort.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language:  console

      FoodOrder(id=1, letter=c, food=coffee with milk)
      FoodOrder(id=2, letter=a, food=donuts and coffee)
      FoodOrder(id=3, letter=a, food=maple syrup)
      FoodOrder(id=4, letter=b, food=coffee with sugar)
      FoodOrder(id=5, letter=a, food=milk and cookies)
      FoodOrder(id=6, letter=c, food=maple donut)

Descending
~~~~~~~~~~

To specify a descending sort, use the ``Sorts.descending()`` static factory
method. Pass the ``Sorts.descending()`` method the name of the field you need to sort in descending order.

The following code snippet shows how to specify a descending sort on the
``_id`` field and return the documents in the
:ref:`sample collection <sorts-crud-sort-sample>`  
in descending order: 

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SortTest.snippet.descending-sort.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output::
      :language:  console

      FoodOrder(id=6, letter=c, food=maple donut)
      FoodOrder(id=5, letter=a, food=milk and cookies)
      FoodOrder(id=4, letter=b, food=coffee with sugar)
      FoodOrder(id=3, letter=a, food=maple syrup)
      FoodOrder(id=2, letter=a, food=donuts and coffee)
      FoodOrder(id=1, letter=c, food=coffee with milk)

.. _sorts-crud-handling-ties:

Handling Ties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A tie occurs when two or more documents have identical values in the field
you are using to order your results. MongoDB does not guarantee sort order in
the event of ties. For example, suppose we encounter a tie when applying a sort
to the :ref:`sample collection <sorts-crud-sort-sample>` using the following
code:
 
.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SortTest.snippet.handle-ties-1.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      FoodOrder(id=3, letter=a, food=maple syrup)
      FoodOrder(id=5, letter=a, food=milk and cookies)
      FoodOrder(id=2, letter=a, food=donuts and coffee)

Since multiple documents that matched our query contain the value "a" for the
field on which we perform the sort, the documents could be returned
in any order.

If you need to guarantee a specific sort order for documents that have fields
with identical values, you can specify additional fields to sort on in the event
of a tie.

We can specify an ascending sort on the ``letter`` field followed by the
``_id`` field return the documents in the
:ref:`sample collection <sorts-crud-sort-sample>`  
in the following order:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SortTest.snippet.handle-ties-2.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      FoodOrder(id=2, letter=a, food=donuts and coffee)
      FoodOrder(id=3, letter=a, food=maple syrup)
      FoodOrder(id=5, letter=a, food=milk and cookies)
      FoodOrder(id=4, letter=b, food=coffee with sugar)
      FoodOrder(id=1, letter=c, food=coffee with milk)
      FoodOrder(id=6, letter=c, food=maple donut)

Combining Sort Criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To combine sort criteria, use the ``Sorts.orderBy()`` static factory
method. This method constructs an object containing an ordered list of sort
criteria. When performing the sort, if the leftmost sort criteria results in a
tie, the sort uses the next sort criteria in the list to determine the order.

In the following code snippet, we use the ``orderBy()`` method to order our data
by performing a descending sort on the ``letter`` field, and in the event of a
tie, by performing an ascending sort on the ``_id`` field, then returns the 
documents in the :ref:`sample collection <sorts-crud-sort-sample>`
in the following order:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SortTest.snippet.combine-sort.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console
      
      FoodOrder(id=1, letter=c, food=coffee with milk)
      FoodOrder(id=6, letter=c, food=maple donut)
      FoodOrder(id=4, letter=b, food=coffee with sugar)
      FoodOrder(id=2, letter=a, food=donuts and coffee)
      FoodOrder(id=3, letter=a, food=maple syrup)
      FoodOrder(id=5, letter=a, food=milk and cookies)

.. _sorts-crud-text-search:

Text Search
-----------

You can specify the order of the results of a 
:manual:`text search </text-search/>` by how closely the string values of
each result's fields specified by the collection's text index match your search
string. The text search assigns a numerical
:manual:`text score </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` to
indicate how closely each result matches the search string. Use the
``Sorts.metaTextScore()`` static factory method to build your sort criteria to
sort by the text score.

.. important:: Make Sure to Create a Text Index

   You need a :manual:`text index </core/index-text/>` on your collection to
   perform a text search. See the server manual documentation for more
   information on how to
   :manual:`create a text index </core/index-text/#create-text-index>`.

In the following code example, we show how you can use the
``Sorts.metaTextScore()`` method to sort the results of a text
search on the :ref:`sample collection <sorts-crud-sort-sample>`.
The code example uses the :doc:`Filters </fundamentals/builders/filters>`,
:doc:`Indexes </fundamentals/builders/indexes>`, and
:doc:`Projections </fundamentals/builders/projections>` builders.

The code example performs the following actions:

#. Creates a text index for your
   :ref:`sample collection <sorts-crud-sort-sample>`
   on the ``food`` field. If you call ``createIndex()`` specifying an index that
   already exists on the collection, the operation does not create a new index.
#. Runs your text search for the phrase "maple donut".
#. Projects text scores into your query results as the
   ``score`` field.
#. Sorts your results by text score (best match first).

The data is modeled with the following Kotlin data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/SortTest.snippet.food-order-score.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. code-block:: kotlin

   import com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Projections
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Filters
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Indexes

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SortTest.snippet.text-search.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      FoodOrderScore(id=6, letter=c, food=maple donut, score=1.5)
      FoodOrderScore(id=3, letter=a, food=maple syrup, score=0.75)
      FoodOrderScore(id=2, letter=a, food=donuts and coffee, score=0.75)

.. note:: Text Search Behavior in MongoDB 4.4 or Later

   The structure of text search has changed for MongoDB 4.4 or later. You no
   longer need to project ``Projections.metaTextScore()`` into your
   ``FindFlow`` instance in order to sort on the text score. In addition,
   the field name you specify in a ``$meta`` text score aggregation operation
   used in a sort is ignored. This means that the field name argument you pass
   to ``Sorts.metaTextScore()`` is disregarded.
