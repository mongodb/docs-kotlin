.. tip:: Bill of Materials

   We recommend adding the JVM driver Bill of Materials (BOM) to your
   application to manage the versions of driver artifacts. This removes
   the need to specify a version for any individual package covered by
   the BOM, simplifying dependency management. To learn more, see :ref:`the Installation Guide <kotlin-get-started-install-bom>`
